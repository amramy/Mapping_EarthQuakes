# Mapping Earthquakes and Plate Tectonics

## Objective: 
Create an earthquake map from current data over the last seven days. Include the ability for the user to select one of three different base layers along with turning on or off any of the three over-layers that will show all earthquakes, major earthquakes, and plate tectonic lines. 

### Results: 

Upon upload this first map is the map you will see.

#### Street View, All Earthquakes including Major Earthquakes and Plate Tectonic lines:

### Conclusion: 
The user can view the map with any combination of the three base layers and the three over layers to see the earthquakes, major earthquakes, and plate tectonics of the world in the last seven days.
